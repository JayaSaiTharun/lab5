    Create a web page content with either <div> tags or HTML5 semantic tags like <section>, 
        <article>, <nave>, <footer>. Next, Create a page and named it as ID_Week5.html. Within this file 
            create at least 1 inline style, an embedded style, and link to an external.css file. Make sure you 
            include at least 1 property which is used in the inline, embedded and external style so a conflict is 
            created. Also include some properties which are unique to each style. 
     Must use different types of selectors like universal selector, adjacent sibling selector, multiple selector, 
     psuedo classes, psuedo elements etc.,

<div class="d2">
    <p>A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple
        selectors, we can include a combinator.
        There are four different combinators in CSS:
        descendant selector (space)
        child selector (>)
        adjacent sibling selector (+)
        general sibling selector (~)</p>
        </div>

        <p>What are Pseudo-classes?
        A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
        For example, it can be used to:
        Style an element when a user mouses over it
        Style visited and unvisited links differently 
        Style an element when it gets focus</p>
</div>
<div class="d4">
<p style="color: crimson">What are Pseudo-Elements?
A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
For example, it can be used to:
Style the first letter, or line, of an element
Insert content before, or after, the content of an element</p>
</div>
