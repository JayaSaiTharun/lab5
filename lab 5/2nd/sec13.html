    <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

            However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

        An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

        A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).</p>
