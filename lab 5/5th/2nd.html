<p>The box-sizing property in CSS defines how the user should calculate the total width and
height of an element i.e padding and borders, are to be included or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="div2">
<p>Property Values: All the properties are described well with the example below.
content-box: This is the default value of the box-sizing property. In this mode, the width and
height properties include only the content. Border and padding are not included in it i.e if we
set an element’s width to 200 pixels, then the element’s content box will be 200 pixels wide,
and the width of any border or padding will be added to the final rendered width.</p>
</div>
<div class="div3">
Example: This example illustrates the use of the box-sizing property whose value is set to
content-box.
</div>
<div class="div4">
    border-box: In this mode, the width and height properties include content, padding, and borders
    i.e if we set an element’s width to 200 pixels, that 200 pixels will include any border or
    padding we added, and the content box will shrink to absorb that extra width. This typically
    makes it much easier to size elements.
